# MinCompSpin BasisSearch 128

# Search for the Best Independent Minimally Complex Models (MCM)

This program searches for the **Best Basis representation for a chosen binary dataset**, while taking into account all possible **high-order patterns of the data**. It was developed for the paper [*Statistical Inference of Minimally Complex Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00520) [1]. More details on the general algorithm can be found in the paper.

The program can be used for datasets with up to $n=128$ random variables.

## General information

The Best basis for a binary data with `n` variables is the one for which the independent model formed by `n` field operators has the largest log-likelihood (and therefore the largest log-evidence, as all independent models with the same number of operators are equivalent -- see Ref[1]).

There are three main functions that you can use to **search for the best basis** from the `main.cpp`:

 1) **Exhaustive Search:** This function will compute all $2^n-1$ operators and will search for the best basis among them with a Greedy approach (i.e. rank them from the most to least biased and extract the set of the `n` most biased independent operators starting from the most biased one):
```c++
vector<Operator64> BestBasis_ExhaustiveSearch(vector<pair<uint64_t, unsigned int>> Nvect, unsigned int n, unsigned int N, bool bool_print = false)
```
Note: we advise doing such a search only for small systems (up to ~15 variables).

 2) **Search in a fixed representation up to order `kmax`:** This function searches for the best Basis among all operators up to order `kmax` in a given representation (which is the representation used when storing the data in `Nvect` -- by default, this is the original representation of the data):
```c++
BestBasisSearch_FixedRepresentation(vector<pair<uint64_t, unsigned int>> Nvect, unsigned int n, unsigned int N, unsigned int k_max, unsigned int B_it, bool bool_print = false)
```
If you take the largest order to be equal to the number of variables (i.e., `kmax = n`), then this function will perform an exhaustive search for the best basis among all possible operators (exactly as the algorithm 1 just above).

 3) **Search in varying representations:** This function performs the search procedure described in Ref.[1]. The program first searches for the best basis up to order `k_max`; the data is then successively transformed in the representation given by the previously found best basis, and the program searches for the new best basis in this representation. The algorithm stops when the new basis found is the identity (i.e. the basis has not changed).
```c++
vector<Operator64> BestBasisSearch_Final(vector<pair<uint64_t, unsigned int>> Nvect, unsigned int n, unsigned int N, unsigned int k_max, bool bool_print = false)
```
This is the recommended approach when the number of variables exceeds $n\simeq 15$ - $20$. A priori, this heuristic approach is able to explore possible basis interactions of arbitrary order.

## Requirements

The code uses the C++11 version of C++.

## Usage without Makefile:

 - **To compile:**
   
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -O3 src/*.cpp includes/main.cpp -o BestBasis.out
```
 - **To Execute:**

The datafile must be placed in the `INPUT` folder.
In the following commands, replace `[datafilename]` by the datafile name, `[n]` by the number of variables, and `[kmax]` by the value of the highest order of operators to consider (when needed).

| Run  | Command | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Help | `./BestBasis.out -h` | |
| Example 1 | `./BestBasis.out`| Will run Example 1 (Shape dataset)<br> See "Examples" section below|
| Search best basis | `./BestBasis.out [datafilename] [n]` | Choose automatically<br>the most appropriate algorithm |
| Exhaustive search (*) | `./BestBasis.out [datafilename] [n] --exhaustive`| |
| Search among all operators<br> up to order kmax | `./BestBasis.out [datafilename] [n] --fix-k [kmax]` | specifying kmax is optional,<br> by default `kmax = 3` |
| Search among all operators<br> up to order kmax<br> in varying representations (**) | `./BestBasis.out [datafilename] [n] --var-k [kmax]` | specifying kmax is optional,<br> by default `kmax = 3` |

(*) This program implements the exhaustive search algorithm described in Ref.[1].

(**) This program implements the heuristic algorithm described in Ref.[1].
 
## Usage with Makefile:

Run the following commands in your terminal, from the root folder (which contains the `makefile` document):

 - **To compile:** `make`

 - **To Execute:**
   The datafile must be placed in the `INPUT` folder.
   Information about your dataset must then be specified at the beginning of the makefile, i.e. the name of the datafile `datafile`, the number of variables `n`, and the value of the highest order of operators to consider `kmax` (if needed).

   Open the makefile and replace the values of the following variables at the very top of the file (an example is provided):
    * `datafile`: name of your datafile; this file must be placed in the folder `INPUT`
    * `n`: number of variables in your file; largest possible value is `n = 128`.
    * [Optional] `kmax`: the highest order of operators to consider (if needed); we advise to take it equal to 3 or 4 (by default `kmax = 3`).

You can then execute the code by running in your terminal one of the following commands (from the root folder):

| Run  | Command | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Help | `make help` | |
| Example 1 | `make example`| Will run Example 1 (Shape dataset)<br> See "Examples" section below |
| Search best basis | `make run` | Choose automatically<br>the most appropriate algorithm |
| Exhaustive search (*) | `make run-exhaustive`| |
| Search among all operators<br> up to order kmax | `make run-fix-k` | specifying kmax is optional,<br> by default `kmax = 3` |
| Search among all operators<br> up to order kmax<br> in varying representations (**) | `make run-var-k` | specifying kmax is optional,<br> by default `kmax = 3` |

(*) This program implements the exhaustive search algorithm described in Ref.[1].

(**) This program implements the heuristic algorithm described in Ref.[1].

 - **To clean:** `make clean` (to use only once you're done using the code)

## Examples

All the functions that can be called from `int main()` are declared at the beginning of the `main.cpp` file. The most useful functions are described in the section "General information" above. 

In the `INPUT` folder, we provided two examples:
  - **Example 1:** The binary dataset `Shapes_n9_Dataset_N1e5.dat` is one of the datasets used as an example in Ref.[1]. This is an artificial dataset generated from three states described in Figure 5.
  - the binary dataset `SCOTUS_n9_N895_Data.dat`, which is the dataset of votes of the US Supreme Court analyzed in Ref.[3] and used as an example in Ref.[1]. 
  - **Example 2:** the binary dataset `Big5-IPC1_VS3_Ne5.dat`: this is a binarized version of the first `100 000` samples of the Big 5 dataset [4], which has `50` variables. See paper [1] for comments on the Best Basis obtained for this dataset.

Each of these two datasets can be the one run as an example by commenting/uncommenting the correct datafile choice at the beginning of the `makefile`.

For hands-on and simple tests of the program, please check the examples in the function `int main()` of the `main.cpp` file.
